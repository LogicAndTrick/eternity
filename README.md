Eternity
========

Eternity is a 2D game engine that uses a full UI layout engine to position and animate sprites.

Eternity's proof of concept is *Eternity Wars*, a clone of the popular *Advance Wars* games. The game sprite sheets are not published, they will eventually be added using copyright-free sprites.

`Eternity.Game.TurnBasedWarsGame` is GPL, all other projects are LGPL.
